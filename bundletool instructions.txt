Generate a set of APKs from your app bundle

When bundletool generates APKs from your app bundle, it includes them in a container called an APK set archive, which uses the .apks file extension. To generate an APK set for all device configurations your app supports from your app bundle, use the bundletool build-apks command, as shown below.

#	bundletool build-apks --bundle=/MyApp/my_app.aab --output=/MyApp/my_app.apks

If you want to deploy the APKs to a device, you need to also include your app’s signing information, as shown in the command below. If you do not specify signing information, bundletool attempts to sign your APKs with a debug key for you.

#	bundletool build-apks --bundle=/MyApp/my_app.aab --output=/MyApp/my_app.apks
	--ks=/MyApp/keystore.jks
	--ks-pass=file:/MyApp/keystore.pwd
	--ks-key-alias=MyKeyAlias
	--key-pass=file:/MyApp/key.pwd

The table below describes the various flags and options you can set when using the bundletool build-apks command in greater detail. Only --bundle and --output are required—all other flags are optional.

Deploy APKs to a connected device


After you generate a set of APKs, bundletool can deploy the right combination of APKs from that set to a connected device.

For example, if you have a connected device running Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher, bundletool pushes the base APK, feature module APKs, and configuration APKs required to run your app on that device. Alternatively, if your connected device is running Android 4.4 (API level 20) or lower, bundletool looks for a compatible multi-APK and deploys it to your device.

To deploy your app from an APK set, use the install-apks command and specify the path of the APK set using the --apks=/path/to/apks flag, as shown below. (If you have multiple devices connected, specify a target device by adding the --device-id=serial-id flag.)

#	bundletool install-apks --apks=/MyApp/my_app.apks
